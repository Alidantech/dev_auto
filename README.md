# Ald-GPT

Ald-GPT is a powerful tool that integrates the amazing capabilities of ChatGPT with code editors like Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and other popular code editors. It revolutionizes the development process by automating code generation and providing an efficient workflow for developers.

## Overview

Ald-GPT simplifies code generation by leveraging the language understanding and code generation abilities of ChatGPT. It is available as a code editor extension, allowing developers to interact with Ald-GPT directly from their preferred editor. By specifying the desired programming language, app structure, and functionality, developers can generate code and set up their projects effortlessly.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Ald-GPT utilizes ChatGPT's advanced language model to generate code snippets, templates, and entire files based on user input. Developers can specify the desired programming language and define the app's structure and functionality, reducing the need for manual coding.

- **Folder Structure Creation**: Ald-GPT automates the creation of a comprehensive folder structure for the app by running terminal commands on the user's machine. It creates the necessary directories, such as source code, configuration files, assets, tests, and more, based on the specified app structure.

- **File Generation**: Ald-GPT generates code and inserts it into the appropriate files within the created folder structure. It eliminates the need for developers to manually copy and paste code from ChatGPT, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.

- **Terminal Command Execution**: Ald-GPT provides suggestions for relevant terminal commands to set up the project and perform common development tasks. It can execute commands like `npx create-react-app`, `composer`, and other development-related commands recommended by ChatGPT, streamlining the project setup process.

## Usage

1. Install the Ald-GPT extension in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Invoke the Ald-GPT prompt within the code editor.
3. Specify the desired programming language, app structure, and functionality using natural language prompts.
4. Ald-GPT will generate the folder structure by running necessary terminal commands on your machine and populate the files with generated code snippets.
5. Customize the generated code as needed to match your project requirements.
6. Benefit from increased productivity and reduced manual effort in code generation and project setup.

Please note that the generated code should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure correctness, adherence to best practices, and alignment with your specific project requirements.
